# PHS Robotics - Timeline

- FEB 19-20
  -	[X] Figure out proximity sensors; troubleshoot
  -	[X] Figure out colour sensor logistics
- FEB 26-27
  -	[X] Test out colour sensors + establish colour ranges for code
  -	[X] Start putting on rest of proximity sensors/colour sensors
- MAR 5-6
  -	[X] Finish putting all the hardware together; basic code for sensors/motors should run properly
- MARCH BREAK
  -	[X] Actual coding (refer to initial document from beginning of year with the code split up)
  -	[X] Aim to get all coding done over March Break (doesn’t have to work/it’s fine if missing any actual measurements; just get the basic frames and layout and overall put together)
- MAR 19-20
  -	[X] Look over each other’s codes, start testing out each component + filling in the measurements and such 
  -	[X] Code should be ready to start testing out for next week
- MAR 26-27
  -	[X] Testing – Goal: able to move continuously without hitting anything / detect all colours successfully
- APR 2-3
  -	[X] Testing – Goal: able to line up in front of stands and retrieve blocks 
- APR 9-10
  -	[X] Any final testings/fixes
